## Interaction Description
The interaction is going to comprise of three different ways of climbing over an object:  
* **Hand Thrusters:** Create hand thrusters to effortlessly soar over obstacles and navigate your environment.
* **Self-launching Bow:** Design a self-launching bow that propels you based on how far back you pull and release, offering dynamic movement.
* **Ball Teleportation:** A ball you can shoot that teleports you to its landing point upon collision.

## Observations
Some observations I made during the user test is that they typically knew how to use each interaction after reading how to use it on the wall. However, they didn't know how to switch the interaction type until I told them to press both middle fingers down (the grip buttons). All of the users enjoyed the experience and some said that it was their favorite interaction out of the whole class, which I really appreciated. After some feedback regarding not being able to do the obstacle course without hitting your head on the rings, I quickly reduced the capsule collider hitbox to make the experience more enjoyable.

## Questions
1. Have you seen this type of VR interaction before?
2. Which one are you most excited to try?
3. How familiar are you with VR interactions for movement, turning, or teleporting?
4. Which interaction was your favorite?
5. Which one was most intuitive?
6. What would you recommend I add or change if we had more time?

## Response to Questions
* Participant 1:
    1. Ender pearl and hand thrusters but not self-launching bow
    2. Self-launching bow
    3. Not too familiar
    4. Iron Man thrusters because of highest learning curve
    5. The ball shooting one because it was clear what would happen
    6. Raycast the arrow to show where you were going to land
* Participant 2:
    1. Kind of, because he has tested mine but never seen it anywhere else
    2. Self-launching bow
    3. Pretty familiar, so like a 4/5
    4. The self-launching bow because it's unique and requires prediction, like launching oneself
    5. Thrusters, but the ball felt very easy to use
    6. Reduce Iron Man force/difficulty
* Participant 3:
    1. Seen thrusters in class, but that's the only time, and has played VR games with ball teleport
    2. Thrusters; the bow also sounds cool though
    3. Doesnâ€™t own VR headset but has played a few games with it, so he's seen a few different kinds of movement
    4. Thrusters, but the bow part was also really fun
    5. Ball shooter like Minecraft ender pearl, but the thrusters were hard to use just because he's never done that movement before
    6. Sound effects and the hitbox
* Participant 4:
    1. No
    2. Self-launching bow
    3. Other than what we've done in this class, that's pretty much it
    4. Iron Man thrusters
    5. Ball because it's like Minecraft ender pearl
    6. Add some vibration feedback
* Participant 5:
    1. No
    2. Self-launching bow
    3. Not super familiar, but most familiarity comes from class projects
    4. Self-launching bow because it was very predictable and easy to use, and the way it was designed was what you would expect for bow movement; simple but gave you enough control
    5. Ball because what you see is what you get, so wherever you shoot the ball is where you go; only issue is that it was harder to predict where you would land because you couldn't see where the ball was landing over a wall
    6. Add curve trajectory for ball
