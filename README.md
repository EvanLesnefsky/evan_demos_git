MoveWays  
Evan Lesnefsky

#### Interaction Description
The interaction is going to comprise of three different ways of climbing over an object:  
* Jetpack: I will create a jeckpack to fly over obstacles and move around.
* Self-launching Bow: I will create a self-launching bow where, depending on how far back the player pulls and lets go, the farther they will launch themselves.
* Climbing Hands: I will create climbing hands that allow you to manually climb up walls by grabbing any part of the wall and pulling yourself up.
